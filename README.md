## How you can testing my bot?

### Step 0 - download jdk

To use any java application you need jdk.
This project supports jdk 21+, you can download jdk from the <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cis/java/technologies/downloads/">official website</a>

### Step 1 - clone repository

      git clone https://github.com/VictorNVK/GameBot.git
      
After cloning the repository, we can proceed with the remaining steps.

### Step 2 - database
So, you need a database. Since I used orm in the project, you can use any sql database. I think there is enough information on the Internet to install and configure the database.

In project you can find application.propeties file. Here you can indicate your database link and other data.

Example:

<img width="467" alt="–°–Ω–∏–º–æ–∫ —ç–∫—Ä–∞–Ω–∞ 2024-08-13 141418" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d9e5225-4a70-452c-a1f7-23dd90dae73f">

### Step 3 - Telegram dataüõ©

First, you need to create your own telegram bot and get its token. How to do this you can find <a href="https://www.siteguarding.com/en/how-to-get-telegram-bot-api-token">here</a>
Then, you need insert your bot-token into application properties

Example:

<img width="196" alt="–°–Ω–∏–º–æ–∫ —ç–∫—Ä–∞–Ω–∞ 2024-08-13 181430" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/33cfb7ce-cee1-4248-a280-14ac3b05b053">

### Step 4 - Run project
If you use ide, you can run project with ide instrunemts. But you not use ide, or you want build project, you can do this with maven build(<a href="https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-jar-plugin/usage.html">link</a>)

Next, you need use this command or just open .jar file.

java -jar GameBot.jar
